# Personal Finance Dashboard
Objective

The goal of this project is to empower users to take full control of their finances by offering an intuitive and comprehensive dashboard. It enables individuals to monitor their expenses, income, and savings in one place, helping them make smarter financial decisions and plan for the future with confidence.

Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle with managing their personal finances because financial data is often scattered across multiple sources — including different bank accounts, credit cards, UPI transactions, and investment platforms. This fragmentation makes it difficult to get a clear overview of one’s financial health.

It not only helps users visualize their spending and income patterns but also offers budgeting and planning tools to support better financial management and goal setting.
